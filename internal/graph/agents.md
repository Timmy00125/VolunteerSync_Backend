# @graphql-agent
- **Scope**: `internal/graph/`
- **Purpose**: Defines and resolves the GraphQL API.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Schema-First**: The API is defined in `schema.graphqls`. Use `gqlgen` to generate models and resolver stubs.
  - **Thin Resolvers**: Resolvers should be lightweight. They translate the GraphQL request and call the appropriate core service to handle the business logic.
  - **Dataloaders**: Use dataloaders to prevent N+1 query problems, especially for nested data (e.g., fetching the organizer for a list of events).
- **Instructions**: When modifying the GraphQL layer, always start with the schema. Ensure resolvers handle errors gracefully and delegate complex logic to the `internal/core` services.

## Generated Code

**IMPORTANT**: Do not manually edit the following files, as they are automatically generated by `gqlgen`:
- `internal/graph/generated/generated.go`
- `internal/graph/model/models_gen.go`
- `internal/graph/schema.resolvers.go`

Any changes in these files will be overwritten the next time the `go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate` command is executed. To make changes to the GraphQL schema or resolvers, modify the `schema.graphqls` file and then run the generate command.
