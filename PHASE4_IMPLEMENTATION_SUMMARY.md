## 🚨 CRITICAL DO-NOTS

### 1. Generated Code

- **NEVER** manually edit `internal/graph/generated/generated.go`
- **NEVER** manually edit auto-generated resolver signatures
- **ALWAYS** use `make gen` after schema changes
- **ALWAYS** preserve existing resolver implementations during regeneration

### 2. Database Migrations

- **NEVER** modify existing migration files (`000004_event_management.*`)
- **ALWAYS** create new migrations for schema changes
- **NEVER** run migrations in production without testing rollback

### 3. Service Layer Dependencies

- **NEVER** import PostgreSQL store directly in service layer
- **ALWAYS** use Repository interface for loose coupling
- **NEVER** put database queries in service methods
- **ALWAYS** handle business logic validation in service layer

### 4. GraphQL Schema Changes

- **NEVER** make breaking changes to existing types
- **ALWAYS** maintain backward compatibility
- **NEVER** change enum values that are already in use
- **ALWAYS** run `make gen` after schema modifications

### 5. Performance Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** perform N+1 queries in resolvers
- **NEVER** fetch unnecessary data from database
- **ALWAYS** implement pagination for list queries
- **ALWAYS** use indexes for search operations
