### 4. Business Logic Service Layer

**File:** `internal/core/event/service.go`

- ✅ EventService struct with dependency injection
- ✅ CreateEvent, UpdateEvent, PublishEvent, CancelEvent methods
- ✅ Comprehensive business validation functions
- ✅ Authorization checks for organizer permissions
- ✅ Slug generation and URL sharing
- ✅ Event lifecycle management
- ✅ Error handling with proper context

### 5. GraphQL Schema Definition

**File:** `internal/graph/schema.graphqls`

- ✅ Comprehensive Event type with 20+ fields
- ✅ EventConnection for pagination support
- ✅ All 16 enums properly defined
- ✅ Input types for create/update operations
- ✅ Query types for search and retrieval
- ✅ Mutation types for event management
- ✅ Integration with existing User types

### 6. GraphQL Resolver Infrastructure

**File:** `internal/graph/resolver.go`

- ✅ EventService dependency injection
- ✅ Proper service layer integration

### 7. Type Conversion Functions

**File:** `internal/graph/converters.go`

- ✅ Complete GraphQL ↔ Domain model converters
- ✅ Complex type conversion (CreateEventInput, UpdateEventInput)
- ✅ Enum mapping between GraphQL and domain models
- ✅ Nested object handling (location, capacity, requirements)
- ✅ Null pointer safety for optional fields

### 8. Partial GraphQL Resolver Implementation

**File:** `internal/graph/schema.resolvers.go`

- ✅ CreateEvent mutation resolver with authentication
- ✅ UpdateEvent mutation resolver with authorization
- ✅ PublishEvent mutation resolver
- ✅ CancelEvent mutation resolver with reason handling
- ✅ Proper error handling and service integration
- ✅ User context extraction from JWT middleware

## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK

### 1. Complete GraphQL Resolvers (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Missing Implementations:**

- `Event(id)` - Single event retrieval
- `EventBySlug(slug)` - SEO-friendly event lookup
- `Events(filter, sort, pagination)` - Event listing with filters
- `SearchEvents(query, filter)` - Full-text search
- `MyEvents(status)` - User's events
- `NearbyEvents(coordinates, radius)` - Geographic search
- `DeleteEvent(id)` - Event deletion
- Image management resolvers (AddEventImage, UpdateEventImage, DeleteEventImage)
- Announcement resolvers (CreateEventAnnouncement)

### 2. PostgreSQL Store Implementation (CRITICAL)

**File:** `internal/store/postgres/event_store.go`

- ❌ **BROKEN**: Uses sqlx incompatible with project standards
- ❌ 30+ compilation errors due to wrong library usage
- ❌ Must convert to standard `sql.DB` patterns
- ❌ All CRUD operations need reimplementation
- ❌ Complex queries for search/filtering broken
- ❌ Geographic queries need PostGIS integration

### 3. Service-Store Integration

- ❌ EventService cannot function without working PostgreSQL store
- ❌ Constructor function needs store dependency injection
- ❌ Error handling between service and store layers

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite

- ❌ Unit tests for service layer business logic
- ❌ Integration tests for repository operations
- ❌ GraphQL resolver tests with mocked services
- ❌ End-to-end API tests for complete workflows
- ❌ Performance tests for search operations

### 5. Additional Features

- ❌ DataLoader implementation for N+1 query prevention
- ❌ Redis caching for frequently accessed events
- ❌ Background job processing for notifications
- ❌ File upload handling for event images
- ❌ Email notification system integration

## 🚨 CRITICAL DO-NOTS

### 1. Generated Code

- **NEVER** manually edit `internal/graph/generated/generated.go`
- **NEVER** manually edit auto-generated resolver signatures
- **ALWAYS** use `make gen` after schema changes
- **ALWAYS** preserve existing resolver implementations during regeneration

### 2. Database Migrations

- **NEVER** modify existing migration files (`000004_event_management.*`)
- **ALWAYS** create new migrations for schema changes
- **NEVER** run migrations in production without testing rollback

### 3. Service Layer Dependencies

- **NEVER** import PostgreSQL store directly in service layer
- **ALWAYS** use Repository interface for loose coupling
- **NEVER** put database queries in service methods
- **ALWAYS** handle business logic validation in service layer

### 4. GraphQL Schema Changes

- **NEVER** make breaking changes to existing types
- **ALWAYS** maintain backward compatibility
- **NEVER** change enum values that are already in use
- **ALWAYS** run `make gen` after schema modifications

### 5. Performance Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** perform N+1 queries in resolvers
- **NEVER** fetch unnecessary data from database
- **ALWAYS** implement pagination for list queries
- **ALWAYS** use indexes for search operations

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Fix PostgreSQL Store (CRITICAL PATH)

1. **Remove sqlx dependency** from `internal/store/postgres/event_store.go`
2. **Convert to sql.DB patterns** following existing user_store.go example
3. **Implement proper query building** with parameter placeholders
4. **Add PostGIS integration** for spatial queries
5. **Test all CRUD operations** individually

### Phase 2: Complete GraphQL Resolvers

1. **Implement query resolvers** (Event, EventBySlug, Events)
2. **Add search functionality** with proper filtering
3. **Implement geographic queries** for nearby events
4. **Add proper pagination** using cursor-based approach
5. **Test resolver authentication** and authorization

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing

1. **Wire up EventService** with working PostgreSQL store
2. **Update main.go** to initialize EventService with dependencies
3. **Create integration tests** for complete workflows
4. **Add performance monitoring** for GraphQL operations
5. **Implement caching layer** for frequently accessed data
