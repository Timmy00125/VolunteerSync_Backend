## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK

### 1. Remaining GraphQL Mutation Resolvers (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Missing Implementations:**

- `DeleteEvent(id)` - Event deletion with proper authorization
- Image management resolvers (AddEventImage, UpdateEventImage, DeleteEventImage)
- Announcement resolvers (CreateEventAnnouncement, UpdateEventAnnouncement, DeleteEventAnnouncement)

### 2. Application Wiring & Dependency Injection (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File:** `cmd/api/main.go`

- ❌ EventService not initialized in main application
- ❌ PostgreSQL store not wired to service layer
- ❌ Missing dependency injection in resolver constructor
- ❌ Event GraphQL resolvers not accessible via API

### 3. Service-Store Integration Testing

- ❌ EventService integration with PostgreSQL store needs validation
- ❌ End-to-end testing of GraphQL queries through full stack
- ❌ Performance testing of complex search operations
- ❌ Geographic query validation with PostGIS

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite

- ❌ Unit tests for service layer business logic
- ❌ Integration tests for repository operations
- ❌ GraphQL resolver tests with mocked services
- ❌ End-to-end API tests for complete workflows
- ❌ Performance tests for search operations

### 5. Additional Features

- ❌ DataLoader implementation for N+1 query prevention
- ❌ Redis caching for frequently accessed events
- ❌ Background job processing for notifications
- ❌ File upload handling for event images
- ❌ Email notification system integration

## 🚨 CRITICAL DO-NOTS

### 1. Generated Code

- **NEVER** manually edit `internal/graph/generated/generated.go`
- **NEVER** manually edit auto-generated resolver signatures
- **ALWAYS** use `make gen` after schema changes
- **ALWAYS** preserve existing resolver implementations during regeneration

### 2. Database Migrations

- **NEVER** modify existing migration files (`000004_event_management.*`)
- **ALWAYS** create new migrations for schema changes
- **NEVER** run migrations in production without testing rollback

### 3. Service Layer Dependencies

- **NEVER** import PostgreSQL store directly in service layer
- **ALWAYS** use Repository interface for loose coupling
- **NEVER** put database queries in service methods
- **ALWAYS** handle business logic validation in service layer

### 4. GraphQL Schema Changes

- **NEVER** make breaking changes to existing types
- **ALWAYS** maintain backward compatibility
- **NEVER** change enum values that are already in use
- **ALWAYS** run `make gen` after schema modifications

### 5. Performance Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** perform N+1 queries in resolvers
- **NEVER** fetch unnecessary data from database
- **ALWAYS** implement pagination for list queries
- **ALWAYS** use indexes for search operations

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

2. **Add image management resolvers** (AddEventImage, UpdateEventImage, DeleteEventImage)
3. **Implement announcement resolvers** for event updates and communications
4. **Test mutation operations** with proper error handling
5. **Validate authorization** for all mutation operations

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (LOWER PRIORITY)

1. **Wire up EventService** with working PostgreSQL store in main.go
2. **Update resolver initialization** to include EventService dependency
3. **Create integration tests** for complete workflows
